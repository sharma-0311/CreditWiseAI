# CreditWiseAI - Intelligent Creditworthiness Prediction App

##  Project Overview

**CreditWiseAI** is a full-fledged, end-to-end credit risk prediction platform built with **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, and **MySQL**, designed for real-world use by financial institutions. This AI-powered app predicts whether a customer is creditworthy based on financial and behavioral attributes, with advanced ML techniques, database logging, SHAP explainability and Gen AI chatbot capabilities.


> Built as part of an internship task to demonstrate end-to-end machine learning pipeline and model explainability.

##  Key Features

-  **Real-time Streamlit** web interface 
-  **Random Forest Classification** and **XGBoost** for improved prediction performance
-  **Data Preprocessing** and feature engineering
-  **Visualizations** to understand feature impact and distributions
-  **Model Evaluation** using classification metrics & ROC AUC
-  **SHAP Explainability** to understand model decisions
-  **Data Logging**: Input and predictions logged in MySQL
-  **AI Chatbot**: LangChain-powered Q&A chatbot (GPT-3.5 / Gemini)
-  **Modular Codebase**: Clean separation of UI, ML, database, and RAG pipeline
-  **Fast & Lightweight**: Optimized for performance and responsiveness
-  No sensitive info used ‚Äî synthetic/academic dataset

##  Problem Statement

> **Goal**: Predict whether a customer is **creditworthy** based on their financial and behavioral attributes using a machine learning approach.

---

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of several financial features such as:

- `Age`, `Income`, `Employment Type`
- `Number of Open Credit Lines`
- `Credit History Length`, `Loan Purpose`
- `Overdue Count`, `Loan Amount`, etc.

> *(Dataset used is cleaned and anonymized/synthetic for academic use.)*
